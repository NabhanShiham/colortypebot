# Discord Reaction Challenge Bot - ColorType  

## Description  
This is a Discord bot built using the `discord.py` library. The bot allows users to challenge each other in a reaction time game, where players must type the correct color corresponding to a randomly displayed emoji. The bot tracks reaction times and declares a winner based on the fastest average response time.  

## Features

🎮 **Multiplayer Support** – Two players can challenge each other in a 5-round game.  
⏱ **Reaction Time Tracking** – The bot calculates and displays each player's average reaction time.  
⏳ **Timeout Handling** – If no one responds in time, the bot applies a penalty and moves to the next round.  
⚙ **Customizable** – Easily extend the list of emojis and colors or modify the number of rounds.
